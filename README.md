# ♪ Meal plan... of the week!! ♪

Make an empty (skeleton) MPOTW file with that starts with (e.g.) a Saturday:
``` sh
python make_empty_MPOTW.py sat
```
Fill in the skeleton file with the names of recipes (all recipes are listed at the end of this file).
For example:
```
Sat Brunch: Daal
Sat Dinner: (Daal)
Sun Brunch: Asiatische Wok
...
```
Then create a shopping list (by default, it creates a shopping list for the most recent MPOTW):
``` sh
python make_shopping_list_from_MPOTW.py
```

Donezies!
